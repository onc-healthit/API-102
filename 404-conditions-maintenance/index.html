<li>While the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s permitted fee.

<li>Fees charged for “value-added services” can arise between an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source and Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> User.</li>
<li>Our goal with the requirement that fees be “objective and verifiable” is to require Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers to apply fee criteria that, among other things, will lead the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee’s amount each time it administers a fee to an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> User.

<li>Any fee for access to the documentation that a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer is required to publish or make available under this Condition of Certification requirement.</li>
<li>Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software developer may reasonably require to make effective use of certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology for any legally permissible purpose.</li>
<li>Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person’s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. These services could include, for example, access to “test environments” and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the information needed to connect to certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the ability to dynamically register with an authorization server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fees for requirements beyond what a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy applications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that interact with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology, and can be classified as permitted fees for value-added services as finalized in § <abbr title="Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(<abbr title="HL7® SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0">a)(3</abbr>)(iv).</li>

<li>“Usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to recover costs typically incurred for supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. That is, “usage-based” fees recover costs incurred by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer due to the actual use of the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology once it has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology).</li>
<li>A Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's “incremental costs” comprise the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's costs that are directly attributable to supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels.</li>
<li>A Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer should “price” its costs of supporting access to the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology by reference to the additional costs that the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer would incur in supporting certain volumes of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> use.</li>
<li>Usage fees for certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology will only apply when the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer acts on behalf of the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source to deploy its certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. In scenarios where the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source’s sole responsibility, and a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees.</li>
<li>The costs recovered under “usage-based” fees can only reflect “post-deployment” costs. As such, “usage-based” fees cannot include any costs necessary to prepare and “get the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology up, running, and ready for use,” which are costs that must be recovered as part of the deployment services delivered by the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer if permitted under § <abbr title="Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(<abbr title="HL7® SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0">a)(3</abbr>)(ii).</li>
<li>We clarify that <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> usage fees related to <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for multiple patients would be calculated using a similar methodology to calculate <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> usage fees related to <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for single patients. These “usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to recover the costs typically incurred to support <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions for <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for multiple patients once these services have been deployed. This could include, but not be limited to, costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology (which could include higher costs for hardware, including server space).</li>

<li>Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers must make available appropriately scoped service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their EHI for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7 FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>).</li>
<li>As discussed in section VIII.C.6.c of the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr>, <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources who locally manage their <abbr title="HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> servers without Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer assistance cannot refuse to provide to Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers the <abbr title="HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URL(s) that is/are necessary for patients to use to access their EHI. Equally, pursuant to this Maintenance of Certification requirement, they would be required to publish the <abbr title="HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URLs they centrally manage on behalf of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources. </li>
<li>To be open and transparent to the public, developers must provide a hyperlink to the list of service base URLs to be published with the product on the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are encouraged to use a standardized format when publishing the service base URLs for all of its customers. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> recommends Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers leverage the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/endpoint.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> 4.0.1 “Endpoint” resource</a>, or profiles of this resource such as the Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU1 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Jan/StructureDefinition-vhdir-endpoint.html" target="_blank">“vhdir-endpoint” profile</a>, to represent service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their health information. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> also encourages developers to provide as much information about the service base URLs as available, including the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source’s organization details, such as name, location, and provider identifiers (e.g., NPI, CCN, or health system ID). These steps will help industry coalesce around standards that enable application developers to more easily and consistently provide patients access to their electronic health information.</li>
