Summary \u00b6 The criterion defined at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) requires certified Health IT Modules to support: Standardized HL7 FHIR -based API for single patient services Standardized HL7 FHIR -based API for multiple patient services Applicability \u00b6 170.315( g)(10 ) is for all health IT developers who are certifying to the EHR base definition. The API certification criterion finalized in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) was included as part of the EHR Base Definition at \u00a7 170.102. While developers of health information technology are not required by the ONC to meet certification requirements, including certification requirements that are included as part of the EHR Base Definition, several federal, state and tribal entities, including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other programs reference the ONC Health IT Certification Program and require the use of certified health IT for program participation. Tools for testing and certification \u00b6 Inferno Program Edition The Inferno Program Edition is used for ( g)(10 ) API testing for the ONC Health IT Certification Program . The Inferno Program Edition is a streamlined testing tool for services seeking to meet the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion finalized at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). It is based on the requirements in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule and associated test procedure for \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). This tool is used for testing and certification to the \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) certification criterion for the ONC Health IT Certification Program . Technical Explanations and Clarifications \u00b6 Applies to Entire Criterion \u00b6 Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): On December 31, 2022, the API certification criterion in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) replaces the \u201capplication access\u2014data category request\u201d certification criterion (\u00a7 170.315( g)(8 )). Health IT Modules are not required to support patient-facing API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients for the purposes of this certification criterion. The clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the \u201cClinical Notes Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(2 ) must be represented in a \u201cplain text\u201d form, and it would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response. The intent of this policy is to prohibit Health IT Modules from converting clinical notes from a \u201cmachine readable\u201d format to a non-\u201cmachine readable\u201d format (e.g., PDF). Clinical note text that originates from outside Health IT Modules should be exchanged using its original format. Additionally, \u201cplain text\u201d does not necessarily mean the FHIR \u201ccontentType\u201d \u201ctext/plain.\u201d The US Core IG Profile \u201cStructureDefinition-us-core-patient\u201d element \u201cname.suffix\u201d is required for testing and certification in the ONC Certification Program to meet the USCDI requirement to support the \u201cPatient Demographics\u201d Data Class: \u201cSuffix\u201d Data Element. Either the US Core IG Profile \u201cStructureDefinition-us-core-patient\u201d element \u201cname.period\u201d or \u201cname.use\u201d is required for testing and certification in the ONC Certification Program to meet the USCDI requirement to support the \u201cPatient Demographics\u201d Data Class: \u201cPrevious Name\u201d Data Element. A Health IT Module must support at least one Choice or Reference for US Core IG \u201cmust support\u201d elements with multiple Choices or References, respectively. A Health IT Module must be conformant to the US Core IG for all Choices and References included in its standardized API , and cannot misrepresent Choices via the standardized API (e.g. a Health IT Module cannot transform \u201cinteger\u201d values to \u201cstring\u201d values). A health IT developer must document which US Core IG Choices and References are supported by their Health IT Module via public technical documentation to meet the requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and the transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Information originating from the ( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Module must conform to the requirements included in the criterion, but legacy information and information from outside systems is not required to be mapped to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) \u201cApplicable Standards\u201d and the US Core IG terminologies and value sets. However, health IT developers are encouraged to exceed the minimum requirements described in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) to support the mapping of legacy information to the terminologies and value sets included in the USCDI and US Core IG where possible. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : Examples of \u201cmust support\u201d in the US Core IG 3.1.1: In US Core 3.1.1, the profile element Observation.value[x] contains the following Choices: Quantity, CodeableConcept, string, boolean, integer, Range, Ratio, SampledData, time, dateTime, Period A Health IT Module must support at least one of these Choices via the ( g)(10 ) standardized API . In US Core 3.1.1, the profile element Provenance.agent.who contains the following References: US Core Practitioner Profile, US Core Patient Profile, US Core Organization Profile A Health IT Module must support at least one of these References via the ( g)(10 ) standardized API . Data Response (Single Patient) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(A) \u00b6 Regulation text : (i) Data response. (A) Respond to requests for a single patient's data according to the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(1 ) and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ), including the mandatory capabilities described in \u201cUS Core Server CapabilityStatement,\u201d for each of the data included in the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 . All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): All data elements and operations indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported and are in-scope for testing. For \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d and \u201cPractitioner,\u201d US Core IG profiles, only the \u201cread\u201d type interaction must be supported and will be included in testing and certification. For the \u201cLocation\u201d FHIR resource, Health IT Modules must either demonstrate support for the \u201cread\u201d type interaction or demonstrate support for providing the \u201cLocation\u201d and FHIR resource references as a contained resource. The \u201csearch\u201d type interactions for these profiles and resource are not in scope for testing and certification. Health IT Modules must support these US Core IG profiles / FHIR resource because they are included as \u201cmust support\u201d data elements in US Core IG profiles required by the USCDI. Health IT Modules must support provenance according to the \u201cBasic Provenance Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG . Data Response (Multiple Patients) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(B) \u00b6 Regulation text : (B) Respond to requests for multiple patients' data as a group according to the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(1 ), and implementation specifications adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ) and (4), for each of the data included in the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 . All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Health IT Modules may support scopes using either \u201csystem/*.read\u201d or a list of \u201csystem/[resource].read,\u201d where [resource] is the FHIR resource name, to enable the export of multiple patients\u2019 data as a group. During testing and certification for multiple patient services, Health IT Modules must demonstrate support for \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d and \u201cPractitioner\u201d US Core IG FHIR Profiles. Health IT Modules must demonstrate support for \u201cLocation\u201d FHIR resources by providing this resource as part of the multiple patient services response, or by including it as a contained resource as part of the multiple patient services response. Health IT Modules must support provenance according to the \u201cBasic Provenance Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG . Supported Search Operations (Single Patient) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(A) \u00b6 Regulation text : (ii) Supported search operations. (A) Respond to search requests for a single patient's data consistent with the search criteria included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ), specifically the mandatory capabilities described in \u201cUS Core Server CapabilityStatement.\u201d Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported and are in scope for testing. Supported Search Operations (Multiple Patients) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(B) \u00b6 Regulation text : (B) Respond to search requests for multiple patients' data consistent with the search criteria included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(a)(4) Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): No additional clarifications. Additional Clarifications : The scope of data available in the data responses defined in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i) must be supported for searches for multiple patients via the supported search operations finalized in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii). The HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR ) (v1.0.0: STU 1) implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215(a)(4) includes mandatory support for the \u201cgroup-export\u201d \u201cOperationDefinition.\u201d Application Registration - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iii) \u00b6 Regulation text : (iii) Application registration. Enable an application to register with the Health IT Module's \u201cauthorization server.\u201d Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Health IT presented for testing and certification must support app registration regardless of the scope of patient search utilized by the application (e.g. single or multiple). This certification criterion requires a health IT developer, as finalized in the Condition of Certification requirements, to demonstrate its registration process, but does not require conformance to a standard. The third-party application registration process that a health IT developer must meet under this criterion is not a form of review or \u201cvetting\u201d for purposes of this criterion. For demonstration of the SMART IG \"Standalone Launch\" steps, health IT developers are permitted to scope US Core IG resources that do not exist in either the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.213 (USCDI version 1) or the \"Compartment Patient\" section of the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(1 ) ( HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1) as either patient/[Resource] or user/[Resource]. These resources include \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cDevice,\u201d \u201cLocation,\u201d \u201cMedication,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d \u201cPractitioner,\u201d and \u201cPractitionerRole.\u201d Health IT developers must document their supported scopes according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii)(A) and \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Secure Connection (Patient / User Scopes) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(A) \u00b6 Regulation text : (iv) Secure connection. (A) Establish a secure and trusted connection with an application that requests data for patient and user scopes in accordance with the implementation specifications adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ) and (3). Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Connections below TLS version 1.2 must be denied. Secure Connection (System Scopes) - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(B) \u00b6 Regulation text : (B) Establish a secure and trusted connection with an application that requests data for system scopes in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(a)(4). Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Connections below TLS version 1.2 must be denied. First-time Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(1) \u00b6 Regulation text : (v) Authentication and authorization\u2014(A) Authentication and authorization for patient and user scopes\u2014(1) First time connections\u2014(i) Authentication and authorization must occur during the process of granting access to patient data in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) and standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(b). (ii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret. (iii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token for a period of no less than three months to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Health IT Modules will be explicitly tested for US Core IG operations using authentication and authorization tokens acquired via the process described in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Only the relevant parts of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 including errata set 1 adopted in \u00a7 170.215(b) that are also included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) will be in-scope for testing and certification. The \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capabilities\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) are explicitly required for testing and certification because these capabilities are otherwise indicated as optional in the implementation specification. As part of the \u201cpermission-patient\u201d \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capability\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ), Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g., \u201cImmunization\u201d) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in \u00a7 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(2 ). Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping resources under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user, using more granular scopes), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on resource-level scopes is available, if requested by the patient. Health IT Modules will only be tested for the \"Patient Access for Standalone Apps\" and \"Clinician Access for EHR Launch\" scenarios described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Since \"Encounter\" is not currently a USCDI Data Class or Data Element, we will not test Health IT Modules for support for \"context-ehr-encounter\" or \"context-standalone-encounter\" SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of the information blocking provisions. As part of the requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii), health IT developers must publish the method(s) by which their Health IT Modules support the secure issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Application developer affirmations to health IT developers regarding the ability of their applications to secure a refresh token, a client secret, or both, must be treated in a good faith manner consistent with the provisions established in the openness and pro-competitive conditions at \u00a7 170.404 (a)(4). Health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native applications and clarify that health IT developers are not required to support all methods third-party application developers seek to use. ONC recognizes there may be some ambiguity in the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 standard (incorporated by reference at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 )) in its guidance for supporting native applications, in particular, in providing references to best practices, strategies, and examples such as \u201cOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps: 8.5. Client Authentication\u201d, \u201cOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\u201d, and \u201cuniversal redirect_uris\u201d without a standardized solution. ONC provides flexibility for how the health IT developer implements the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework implementation specification, as long as the Certified Health IT Module supports for first time connections the issuance of three-month refresh tokens to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. The paragraph at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (SMART IG ) \u201cSMART [on FHIR ] Core Capabilities,\u201d including \u201cpermission-offline,\u201d which grants support for refresh tokens. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule states, \u201c\u2026Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization. If the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires\u2026\u201d ( 85 FR 25747 ). However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. ONC clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application\u2019s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant \u201coffline-access\u201d scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access. Subsequent Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(2) \u00b6 Regulation text : (2) Subsequent connections. (i) Access must be granted to patient data in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) without requiring reauthorization and re-authentication when a valid refresh token is supplied by the application. (ii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): No additional clarifications. Authentication / Authorization for Multiple Patient Services - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(B) \u00b6 Regulation text : (B) Authentication and authorization for system scopes. Authentication and authorization must occur during the process of granting an application access to patient data in accordance with the \u201cSMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide\u201d section of the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(a)(4) and the application must be issued a valid access token. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): No additional clarifications. Patient Authorization Revocation - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(VI) \u00b6 Regulation text : (vi) Patient authorization revocation. A Health IT Module's authorization server must be able to revoke an authorized application's access at a patient's direction. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): This is a functional requirement to allow health IT developers the ability to implement it in a way that best suits their existing infrastructure and allows for innovative models for authorization revocation to develop. Patients are expected to have the ability to revoke an authorized application\u2019s access to their EHI at any time. Token Introspection - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(VII) \u00b6 Regulation text : (vii) Token introspection. A Health IT Module's authorization server must be able to receive and validate tokens it has issued. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Although ONC does not specify a standard for token introspection, ONC encourages industry to coalesce around using a common standard, like OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662). Technical API Documentation Content - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(VIII)(A) \u00b6 Regulation text : (viii) Documentation. (A) The API (s) must include complete accompanying documentation that contains, at a minimum: (1) API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported and their data types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and exception handling methods and their returns. (2) The software components and configurations that would be necessary for an application to implement in order to be able to successfully interact with the API and process its response(s). (3) All applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for an application to be registered with a Health IT Module's authorization server. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Health IT developers are not required to re-publish documentation from the adopted standards and implementation specifications. However, health IT developers must publish documentation that goes beyond the adopted standards and implementation specifications. Health IT developers are expected to disclose any additional data their \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Module supports in the context of the adopted standards and implementation specifications. Technical API Documentation Availability - \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(VIII)(B) \u00b6 Regulation text : (B) The documentation used to meet paragraph ( g)(10 )(viii)(A) of this section must be available via a publicly accessible hyperlink without any preconditions or additional steps. Clarifications Included in ( g)(10 ) Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): No additional clarifications. Other standards not directly referenced in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) \u00b6 Bulk FHIR Import \u00b6 We have not included a requirement for Bulk FHIR import because the standards for these features are still being developed by industry. Applications or systems seeking to import information formatting according to the HL7 \u00ae FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR ) (V1.0.0:STU 1) can use several methods developed by industry, or can refer to Bulk FHIR import methods being defined by HL7 at the HL7 FHIR Bulk Data GitHub page.

Only the relevant parts of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 including errata set 1 adopted in \u00a7 170.215(b) that are also included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) will be in-scope for testing and certification. The \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capabilities\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) are explicitly required for testing and certification because these capabilities are otherwise indicated as optional in the implementation specification. As part of the \u201cpermission-patient\u201d \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capability\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ), Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g., \u201cImmunization\u201d) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in \u00a7 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(2 ). Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping resources under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user, using more granular scopes), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on resource-level scopes is available, if requested by the patient. Health IT Modules will only be tested for the \"Patient Access for Standalone Apps\" and \"Clinician Access for EHR Launch\" scenarios described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Since \"Encounter\" is not currently a USCDI Data Class or Data Element, we will not test Health IT Modules for support for \"context-ehr-encounter\" or \"context-standalone-encounter\" SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of the information blocking provisions. As part of the requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii), health IT developers must publish the method(s) by which their Health IT Modules support the secure issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Application developer affirmations to health IT developers regarding the ability of their applications to secure a refresh token, a client secret, or both, must be treated in a good faith manner consistent with the provisions established in the openness and pro-competitive conditions at \u00a7 170.404 (a)(4). Health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native applications and clarify that health IT developers are not required to support all methods third-party application developers seek to use. ONC recognizes there may be some ambiguity in the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 standard (incorporated by reference at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 )) in its guidance for supporting native applications, in particular, in providing references to best practices, strategies, and examples such as \u201cOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps: 8.5. Client Authentication\u201d, \u201cOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\u201d, and \u201cuniversal redirect_uris\u201d without a standardized solution. ONC provides flexibility for how the health IT developer implements the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework implementation specification, as long as the Certified Health IT Module supports for first time connections the issuance of three-month refresh tokens to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. The paragraph at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (SMART IG ) \u201cSMART [on FHIR ] Core Capabilities,\u201d including \u201cpermission-offline,\u201d which grants support for refresh tokens. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule states, \u201c\u2026Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization. If the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires\u2026\u201d ( 85 FR 25747 ). However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. ONC clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application\u2019s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant \u201coffline-access\u201d scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access.","title":"First-time Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services - \u00a7 170.315(g)(10)(V)(A)(1)"},{"location":"g10-criterion/#subsequent-authentication-authorization-for-single-patient-services-170315g10va2","text":"Regulation text : (2) Subsequent connections.
