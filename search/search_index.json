Applicability \u00b6 \u00a7 170.404 applies to all health IT developers with health IT certified to \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ) \u2013 \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). We described several actors in the preamble and regulation text for \u00a7 170.404 . These actors are defined at \u00a7 170.404 (c) , and include \u201c API Information Source\u201d, \u201c API User\u201d, and \u201cCertified API Developer\u201d. We clarified in preamble and have included in the CCG for \u00a7\u2009 170.404 that \u201cA person or entity is permitted to serve more than one role for the terms defined in \u00a7 170.404 (c)\u201d and \u201cStakeholders meet the definition of a term defined in \u00a7 170.404 (c) based on the context in which they are acting.\u201d Generally, the API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements finalized in \u00a7\u2009 170.404 apply to Certified API Developers only, which are health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ), \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 ), \u00a7 170.315( g)(9 ) and/or \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). API Users and API Information Sources, unless they are also acting as a Certified API Developer, are not required to conform to \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) or abide by the requirements in \u00a7\u2009 170.404 . The ONC Health IT Certification Program does not have certification criteria for patientfacing applications developed by API Users. Certified APIs and the HIPAA Privacy Rule \u00b6 Certified API Developers must publish Service Base URLs for patient access. Certified API Developers are required to publish Service Base URLs (\u00a7 170.404 (b)) that can be used by patients to exercise their HIPAA Privacy Rule right of access. Additionally, the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services can be used by entities to share treatment, payment, and health care operations information with other authorized parties. The Office of Civil Rights created a page titled \u201c The access right, health apps, & APIs \u201d which explains some of these clarifications in context of APIs . Information Clarifications \u00b6 Entire Criterion \u00b6 Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to the entire criterion The Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements only apply to practices of Certified API Developers with respect to the capabilities included in \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ) through (10). Additional Clarifications included to the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ): Regarding the recommendation by commenters that the scope of \u201call data elements\u201d include the Data Elements of the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 and FHIR resources referenced by the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ), we note that both the standard and implementation specification are included in the interpretation of \u201call data elements of a patient's electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws\u201d above. We note that this specific interpretation does not extend beyond the API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements finalized in \u00a7\u2009 170.404 and cannot be inferred to reduce the scope or applicability of other Cures Act Conditions of Certification or the information blocking provisions of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule , which include a larger scope of data. API Condition Of Certification General Requirements - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(1) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(1) (a) Condition of certification requirements\u2014(1) General. A Certified API Developer must publish APIs and allow electronic health information from such technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable law, including providing access to all data elements of a patient's electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(1) The data required and that must be supported to demonstrate conformance to the final \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ) certification criterion (including all of its associated standards and implementation specifications) constitutes \u201call data elements of a patient\u2019s electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws.\u201d API Transparency Conditions - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(2) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(2) (2) Transparency conditions\u2014(i) Complete business and technical documentation. A Certified API Developer must publish complete business and technical documentation, including the documentation described in paragraph ( a)(2 )(ii) of this section, via a publicly accessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly access the information without any preconditions or additional steps. (ii) Terms and conditions\u2014(A) Material information. A Certified API Developer must publish all terms and conditions for its certified API technology, including any fees, restrictions, limitations, obligations, registration process requirements, or other similar requirements that would be: (1) Needed to develop software applications to interact with the certified API technology; (2) Needed to distribute, deploy, and enable the use of software applications in production environments that use the certified API technology; (3) Needed to use software applications, including to access, exchange, and use electronic health information by means of the certified API technology; (4) Needed to use any electronic health information obtained by means of the certified API technology; (5) Used to verify the authenticity of API Users; and (6) Used to register software applications. (B) API fees. Any and all fees charged by a Certified API Developer for the use of its certified API technology must be described in detailed, plain language. The description of the fees must include all material information, including but not limited to: (1) The persons or classes of persons to whom the fee applies; (2) The circumstances in which the fee applies; and (3) The amount of the fee, which for variable fees must include the specific variable(s) and methodology(ies) that will be used to calculate the fee. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(2) This provision of the Condition of Certification requirements does not prohibit additional content or limit the type of content a Certified API Developer may include in its terms and conditions. A Certified API Developer would be permitted to include consumer protections in its terms and conditions documentation. As part of the requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii), health IT developers must publish the method(s) by which their Health IT Modules support the secure issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). API Fees - General Conditions - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(I) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(I) (3) Fees conditions\u2014(i) General conditions\u2014(A) All fees. All fees related to certified API technology not otherwise permitted by this section are prohibited from being imposed by a Certified API Developer. The permitted fees in paragraphs ( a)(3 )(ii) and (iv) of this section may include fees that result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with \u00a7\u2009171.302. (B) Permitted fees requirements. For all permitted fees, a Certified API Developer must: (1) Ensure that such fees are based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to all similarly situated API Information Sources and API Users; (2) Ensure that such fees imposed on API Information Sources are reasonably related to the Certified API Developer's costs to supply certified API technology to, and if applicable, support certified API technology for, API Information Sources; (3) Ensure that such fees to supply and, if applicable, support certified API technology are reasonably allocated among all similarly situated API Information Sources; and (4) Ensure that such fees are not based on whether API Information Sources or API Users are competitors, potential competitors, or will be using the certified API technology in a way that facilitates competition with the Certified API Developer. (C) Prohibited fees. A Certified API Developer is prohibited from charging fees for the following: (1) Costs associated with intangible assets other than actual development or acquisition costs of such assets; (2) Opportunity costs unrelated to the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information; and (3) The permitted fees in this section cannot include any costs that led to the creation of intellectual property if the actor charged a royalty for that intellectual property pursuant to \u00a7\u2009171.303 and that royalty included the development costs for the creation of the intellectual property. (D) Record-keeping requirements. A Certified API Developer must keep for inspection detailed records of any fees charged with respect to the certified API technology, the methodology(ies) used to calculate such fees, and the specific costs to which such fees are attributed. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(I) Certified API Developers and API Users have the ability to collaborate and form relationships, so long as these relationships do not conflict with any of the provisions of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule or other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. While the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified API Developers are permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the Certified API Developer\u2019s permitted fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which a Certified API Developer may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee. Fees charged for \u201cvalue-added services\u201d can arise between an API Information Source and Certified API Developer or API User. Our goal with the requirement that fees be \u201cobjective and verifiable\u201d is to require Certified API Developers to apply fee criteria that, among other things, will lead the Certified API Developer to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee\u2019s amount each time it administers a fee to an API Information Source or API User. Accordingly, the fee cannot be based on the Certified API Developer\u2019s subjective judgment or discretion. Non-exhaustive examples of fees for services that Certified API Developers would be prohibited from charging: Any fee for access to the documentation that a Certified API Developer is required to publish or make available under this Condition of Certification requirement. Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software developer may reasonably require to make effective use of certified API technology for any legally permissible purpose. Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person\u2019s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use certified API technology. These services could include, for example, access to \u201ctest environments\u201d and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the information needed to connect to certified API technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the ability to dynamically register with an authorization server. Fees for requirements beyond what a Certified API Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy applications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that interact with certified API technology, and can be classified as permitted fees for value-added services as finalized in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iv). The API Condition and Maintenance of Certification covers a narrower scope of potential fees than the information blocking section. The fees in this Condition and Maintenance of Certification are specific to certified API technology while the fees discussed in the information blocking section relate to the access, exchange, or use of EHI regardless of the particular technology used. Additional Clarifications to the \u00a7 170.404 CCG : A requirement in \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(i)(A) states that permitted fees in paragraphs \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii) and \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iv) may include fees that result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with the information blocking Fees Exception finalized in \u00a7\u2009171.302. Any fee that is not covered by an exception would be suspect under the information blocking provisions established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule , and would equally not be permitted by this API Condition of Certification requirement. Health IT developers are permitted to offer discounts to customers, as long as the discounted fees do not constitute information blocking and otherwise conform to ONC Cures Act Final Rule requirements as well as all other applicable laws. API Fees \u2013 Permitted Fee (Development, Deployment, Upgrades) - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(II) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(II) (ii) Permitted fee\u2014development, deployment, and upgrades. A Certified API Developer is permitted to charge fees to an API Information Source to recover the costs reasonably incurred by the Certified API Developer to develop, deploy, and upgrade certified API technology. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(II) The nature of the costs charged under \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii) depends on the scope of the work to be undertaken by a Certified API Developer (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires of the Certified API Developer to deploy and upgrade the certified API technology). Regarding the \u201cdevelopment, deployment, and upgrades\u201d described in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), while we understand that there is overlap between features of the certified API technology and the \u201cbroader EHR product,\u201d we refer specifically to development, deployment, and upgrades made to \u201ccertified API technology\u201d as defined in \u00a7 170.404 (c). Namely, development, deployment, and upgrades made to the capabilities of certified Health IT Modules that fulfill the API -focused certification criteria adopted at \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ) through (10). Regarding the use of the term \u201cdeveloping\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), fees for \u201cdeveloping\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of designing, developing, and testing certified API technology. Fees for developing certified API technology must not include the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of updating the non- API related capabilities of the Certified API Developer\u2019s existing Health IT Modules, including its databases, as part of its development of the certified API technology. These costs are typically connected to past business decisions made by the Certified API Developer and typically arise due to Health IT Modules being designed or implemented in nonstandard ways that unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. Regarding the use of the term \u201cdeploying\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), a Certified API Developer\u2019s fees for \u201cdeploying\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of operationalizing certified API technology in a production environment. Such fees include, but are not limited to, standing up hosting infrastructure, software installation and configuration, and the creation and maintenance of API Information Source administrative functions. Fees for \u201cdeploying\u201d certified API technology do not include the costs associated with managing the traffic of API calls that are used to access the certified API technology, which a Certified API Developer can only recover under the permitted fee for usage support costs (\u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iii)). We emphasize that for the purpose of this Condition of Certification, we consider that certified API technology is \u201cdeployed\u201d by the customer\u2014the API Information Source\u2014that purchased or licensed it. Regarding the use of the term \u201cupgrading\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), a Certified API Developer\u2019s fees for \u201cupgrading\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of supplying an API Information Source with an updated version of certified API technology. Such costs would include the costs required to bring certified API technology into conformity with new requirements of the Program, upgrades to implement general software updates (not otherwise covered by development fees or under warranty), or developing and releasing newer versions of the certified API technology at the request of an API Information Source. The nature of the costs that can be charged under this category of permitted fees depends on the scope of the work undertaken by a Certified API Developer (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires of the Certified API Developer to upgrade the certified API technology being supplied from one version or set of functions to the next). Should API Users generate revenue from the use of their apps, any fee an API Information Source may impose would not be in scope for this Condition and Maintenance of Certification, but could be covered by the information blocking provisions. Accordingly, we emphasize that such stakeholders should take care to ensure they are compliant with the information blocking provisions and other Federal and State laws and regulations that may prohibit or limit certain types of relationships involving remuneration. Additional Clarifications to the \u00a7 170.404 CCG : Should API Users stand to generate revenue from the use of their apps, any fee an API Information Source may impose would not be in scope for this Condition of Certification but would be subject to information blocking provisions established by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule if the API Information Source is a \u201ccovered actor\u201d for purposes of information blocking. Accordingly, we emphasize that such stakeholders should take care to ensure they do not engage in information blocking and are compliant with other Federal and State laws and regulations that may prohibit or limit certain types of relationships involving remuneration. API Fees \u2013 Permitted Fee (Recovering API Usage Costs) - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(III) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(III) (iii) Permitted fee\u2014recovering API usage costs. A Certified API Developer is permitted to charge fees to an API Information Source related to the use of certified API technology. The fees must be limited to the recovery of incremental costs reasonably incurred by the Certified API Developer when it hosts certified API technology on behalf of the API Information Source. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(III) \u201cUsage-based\u201d fees are fees imposed by a Certified API Developer to recover costs typically incurred for supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. That is, \u201cusage-based\u201d fees recover costs incurred by a Certified API Developer due to the actual use of the certified API technology once it has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified API technology). A Certified API Developer's \u201cincremental costs\u201d comprise the Certified API Developer's costs that are directly attributable to supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. A Certified API Developer should \u201cprice\u201d its costs of supporting access to the certified API technology by reference to the additional costs that the Certified API Developer would incur in supporting certain volumes of API use. Usage fees for certified API technology will only apply when the Certified API Developer acts on behalf of the API Information Source to deploy its certified API technology. In scenarios where the API Information Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified API technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the API Information Source\u2019s sole responsibility, and a Certified API Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees. The costs recovered under \u201cusage-based\u201d fees can only reflect \u201cpost-deployment\u201d costs. As such, \u201cusage-based\u201d fees cannot include any costs necessary to prepare and \u201cget the certified API technology up, running, and ready for use,\u201d which are costs that must be recovered as part of the deployment services delivered by the Certified API Developer if permitted under \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii). We clarify that API usage fees related to API \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients would be calculated using a similar methodology to calculate API usage fees related to API \u201cread\u201d services for single patients. These \u201cusage-based\u201d fees are fees imposed by a Certified API Developer to recover the costs typically incurred to support API interactions for API \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients once these services have been deployed. This could include, but not be limited to, costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified API technology (which could include higher costs for hardware, including server space). API Fees \u2013 Permitted Fee (Value-Added Services) - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(IV) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(IV) (iv) Permitted fee\u2014value-added services. A Certified API Developer is permitted to charge fees to an API User for value-added services related to certified API technology, so long as such services are not necessary to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready software that interacts with certified API technology. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(IV) We clarify that the value-added services need to be provided in connection with and supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of production-ready software applications that interact with certified API technology. A fee is permitted if it relates to a service that a software developer can elect to purchase from a Certified API Developer, but is not required to purchase in order to develop and deploy production-ready apps for certified API technology. We note that examples used to illustrate when a fee would or would not qualify as a \u201cvalue-added service,\u201d such as app store listing, are demonstrative, but not required unless otherwise noted in the regulation text. We permit fees for services associated with the listing and promotion of apps beyond basic application placement so long as the Certified API Developer ensures that basic access and listing in the app store is provided free of charge (if an application developer depended on such listing to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps for use with certified API technology). To the degree that a health IT developer offers value-added services associated with certified API technology, the Condition of Certification covers its practices related to certified API technology only. Conversely, this Condition of Certification would not apply to any practices that do not involve certified API technology. API Openness And Pro-Competitive Conditions - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(4) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(4) (4) Openness and pro-competitive conditions; general condition. A Certified API Developer must grant an API Information Source the independent ability to permit an API User to interact with the certified API technology deployed by the API Information Source. (i) Nondiscrimination. (A) A Certified API Developer must provide certified API technology to an API Information Source on terms that are no less favorable than it provides to itself and its own customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a business relationship. (B) The terms on which a Certified API Developer provides certified API technology must be based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to all substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests. (C) A Certified API Developer must not offer different terms or services based on: (1) Whether a competitive relationship exists or would be created; (2) The revenue or other value that another party may receive from using the API technology. (ii) Rights to access and use certified API technology\u2014 (A) Rights that must be granted. A Certified API Developer must have and, upon request, must grant to API Information Sources and API Users all rights that may be reasonably necessary to: (1) Access and use the Certified API Developer's certified API technology in a production environment; (2) Develop products and services that are designed to interact with the Certified API Developer's certified API technology; and (3) Market, offer, and distribute products and services associated with the Certified API Developer's certified API technology. (B) Prohibited conduct. A Certified API Developer is prohibited from conditioning the receipt of the rights described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section on: (1) Receiving a fee, including but not limited to a license fee, royalty, or revenue-sharing arrangement; (2) Agreeing to not compete with the Certified API Developer in any product, service, or market; (3) Agreeing to deal exclusively with the Certified API Developer in any product, service, or market; (4) Obtaining additional licenses, products, or services that are not related to or can be unbundled from the certified API technology; (5) Licensing, granting, assigning, or transferring any intellectual property to the Certified API Developer; (6) Meeting any Certified API Developer-specific testing or certification requirements; and (7) Providing the Certified API Developer or its technology with reciprocal access to application data. (iii) Service and support obligations. A Certified API Developer must provide all support and other services reasonably necessary to enable the effective development, deployment, and use of certified API technology by API Information Sources and API Users in production environments. (A) Changes and updates to certified API technology. A Certified API Developer must make reasonable efforts to maintain the compatibility of its certified API technology and to otherwise avoid disrupting the use of certified API technology in production environments. (B) Changes to terms and conditions. Except as exigent circumstances require, prior to making changes to its certified API technology or to the terms and conditions thereof, a Certified API Developer must provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for API Information Sources and API Users to update their applications to preserve compatibility with certified API technology and to comply with applicable terms and conditions. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(4) For the requirement that a Certified API Developer must provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for API Information Sources and API Users to update their applications to preserve compatibility with certified API technology and to comply with applicable terms and conditions, we note that the notice could include a public notice made available on a website, but also encourage Certified API Developers to contact API Information Source customers and registered API Users (application developers) directly prior to updating business and technical documentation. For third-party applications chosen by individuals to facilitate their access to their electronic health information (EHI) held by actors, there would not be a need for a business associate agreement as discussed in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule . There would also generally not be a need for \u201cvetting\u201d on security grounds and such vetting actions otherwise would be an interference. We clarify that this rule does not prohibit Certified API Developers from forming business relationships with API Users. Application developer affirmations to health IT developers regarding the ability of their applications to secure a refresh token, a client secret, or both, must be treated in a good faith manner consistent with the provisions established in the openness and pro-competitive conditions at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (a)(4). API Maintenance Of Certification Requirements - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(1) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(1) (b) Maintenance of certification requirements\u2014(1) Authenticity verification and registration for production use. The following apply to a Certified API Developer with a Health IT Module certified to the certification criterion adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ): (i) Authenticity verification. A Certified API Developer is permitted to institute a process to verify the authenticity of API Users so long as such process is objective and the same for all API Users and completed within ten business days of receipt of an API User's request to register their software application for use with the Certified API Developer's Health IT Module certified to \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ). (ii) Registration for production use. A Certified API Developer must register and enable all applications for production use within five business days of completing its verification of an API User's authenticity, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(1) This requirement applies to a Certified API Developer with a Health IT Module certified to the certification criterion adopted in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). The authenticity verification process finalized in \u00a7 170.404 (b)(1)(i) is optional, but if instituted, the authenticity verification process must be completed within 10 business days. API Service Base URL Publication - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(2) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(2) (2) Service base URL publication. A Certified API Developer must publish the service base URLs for all Health IT Modules certified to \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ) that can be used by patients to access their electronic health information. The Certified API Developer must publicly publish the service base URLs: (i) For all of its customers regardless of whether the Health IT Modules certified to \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ) are centrally managed by the Certified API Developer or locally deployed by an API Information Source; and (ii) In a machine-readable format at no charge. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(2) Certified API Developers must make available appropriately scoped service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their EHI for Health IT Modules certified to \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). As discussed in section VIII.C.6.c of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule , API Information Sources who locally manage their FHIR servers without Certified API Developer assistance cannot refuse to provide to Certified API Developers the FHIR service base URL(s) that is/are necessary for patients to use to access their EHI. Equally, pursuant to this Maintenance of Certification requirement, they would be required to publish the FHIR service base URLs they centrally manage on behalf of API Information Sources. To be open and transparent to the public, developers must provide a hyperlink to the list of service base URLs to be published with the product on the ONC Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). Certified API Developers are encouraged to use a standardized format when publishing the service base URLs for all of its customers. ONC recommends Certified API Developers leverage the HL7 FHIR 4.0.1 \u201cEndpoint\u201d resource , or profiles of this resource such as the Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU1 \u201cvhdir-endpoint\u201d profile , to represent service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their health information. ONC also encourages developers to provide as much information about the service base URLs as available, including the API Information Source\u2019s organization details, such as name, location, and provider identifiers (e.g., NPI, CCN, or health system ID). These steps will help industry coalesce around standards that enable application developers to more easily and consistently provide patients access to their electronic health information. Rollout Of (G)(10)-Certifies APIs - \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(3) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (B)(2) (3) Rollout of ( g)(10 )-certified APIs .

The permitted fees in paragraphs ( a)(3 )(ii) and (iv) of this section may include fees that result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with \u00a7\u2009171.302. (B) Permitted fees requirements. For all permitted fees, a Certified API Developer must: (1) Ensure that such fees are based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to all similarly situated API Information Sources and API Users; (2) Ensure that such fees imposed on API Information Sources are reasonably related to the Certified API Developer's costs to supply certified API technology to, and if applicable, support certified API technology for, API Information Sources; (3) Ensure that such fees to supply and, if applicable, support certified API technology are reasonably allocated among all similarly situated API Information Sources; and (4) Ensure that such fees are not based on whether API Information Sources or API Users are competitors, potential competitors, or will be using the certified API technology in a way that facilitates competition with the Certified API Developer. (C) Prohibited fees. A Certified API Developer is prohibited from charging fees for the following: (1) Costs associated with intangible assets other than actual development or acquisition costs of such assets; (2) Opportunity costs unrelated to the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information; and (3) The permitted fees in this section cannot include any costs that led to the creation of intellectual property if the actor charged a royalty for that intellectual property pursuant to \u00a7\u2009171.303 and that royalty included the development costs for the creation of the intellectual property. (D) Record-keeping requirements. A Certified API Developer must keep for inspection detailed records of any fees charged with respect to the certified API technology, the methodology(ies) used to calculate such fees, and the specific costs to which such fees are attributed. Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(I) Certified API Developers and API Users have the ability to collaborate and form relationships, so long as these relationships do not conflict with any of the provisions of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule or other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. While the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified API Developers are permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the Certified API Developer\u2019s permitted fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which a Certified API Developer may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee. Fees charged for \u201cvalue-added services\u201d can arise between an API Information Source and Certified API Developer or API User. Our goal with the requirement that fees be \u201cobjective and verifiable\u201d is to require Certified API Developers to apply fee criteria that, among other things, will lead the Certified API Developer to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee\u2019s amount each time it administers a fee to an API Information Source or API User. Accordingly, the fee cannot be based on the Certified API Developer\u2019s subjective judgment or discretion. Non-exhaustive examples of fees for services that Certified API Developers would be prohibited from charging: Any fee for access to the documentation that a Certified API Developer is required to publish or make available under this Condition of Certification requirement. Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software developer may reasonably require to make effective use of certified API technology for any legally permissible purpose. Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person\u2019s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use certified API technology. These services could include, for example, access to \u201ctest environments\u201d and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the information needed to connect to certified API technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the ability to dynamically register with an authorization server. Fees for requirements beyond what a Certified API Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy applications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that interact with certified API technology, and can be classified as permitted fees for value-added services as finalized in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iv). The API Condition and Maintenance of Certification covers a narrower scope of potential fees than the information blocking section. The fees in this Condition and Maintenance of Certification are specific to certified API technology while the fees discussed in the information blocking section relate to the access, exchange, or use of EHI regardless of the particular technology used. Additional Clarifications to the \u00a7 170.404 CCG : A requirement in \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(i)(A) states that permitted fees in paragraphs \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii) and \u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iv) may include fees that result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with the information blocking Fees Exception finalized in \u00a7\u2009171.302. Any fee that is not covered by an exception would be suspect under the information blocking provisions established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule , and would equally not be permitted by this API Condition of Certification requirement. Health IT developers are permitted to offer discounts to customers, as long as the discounted fees do not constitute information blocking and otherwise conform to ONC Cures Act Final Rule requirements as well as all other applicable laws.","title":"API Fees - General Conditions - \u00a7\u2009170.404(A)(3)(I)"},{"location":"404-conditions-maintenance/#api-fees-permitted-fee-development-deployment-upgrades-170404a3ii","text":"Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(II) (ii) Permitted fee\u2014development, deployment, and upgrades.

Clarifications included in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide ( CCG ) that apply to paragraph \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(II) The nature of the costs charged under \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii) depends on the scope of the work to be undertaken by a Certified API Developer (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires of the Certified API Developer to deploy and upgrade the certified API technology). Regarding the \u201cdevelopment, deployment, and upgrades\u201d described in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), while we understand that there is overlap between features of the certified API technology and the \u201cbroader EHR product,\u201d we refer specifically to development, deployment, and upgrades made to \u201ccertified API technology\u201d as defined in \u00a7 170.404 (c). Namely, development, deployment, and upgrades made to the capabilities of certified Health IT Modules that fulfill the API -focused certification criteria adopted at \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ) through (10). Regarding the use of the term \u201cdeveloping\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), fees for \u201cdeveloping\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of designing, developing, and testing certified API technology. Fees for developing certified API technology must not include the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of updating the non- API related capabilities of the Certified API Developer\u2019s existing Health IT Modules, including its databases, as part of its development of the certified API technology. These costs are typically connected to past business decisions made by the Certified API Developer and typically arise due to Health IT Modules being designed or implemented in nonstandard ways that unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. Regarding the use of the term \u201cdeploying\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), a Certified API Developer\u2019s fees for \u201cdeploying\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of operationalizing certified API technology in a production environment. Such fees include, but are not limited to, standing up hosting infrastructure, software installation and configuration, and the creation and maintenance of API Information Source administrative functions. Fees for \u201cdeploying\u201d certified API technology do not include the costs associated with managing the traffic of API calls that are used to access the certified API technology, which a Certified API Developer can only recover under the permitted fee for usage support costs (\u00a7\u2009 170.404 ( a)(3 )(iii)). We emphasize that for the purpose of this Condition of Certification, we consider that certified API technology is \u201cdeployed\u201d by the customer\u2014the API Information Source\u2014that purchased or licensed it. Regarding the use of the term \u201cupgrading\u201d in \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii), a Certified API Developer\u2019s fees for \u201cupgrading\u201d certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer\u2019s costs of supplying an API Information Source with an updated version of certified API technology. Such costs would include the costs required to bring certified API technology into conformity with new requirements of the Program, upgrades to implement general software updates (not otherwise covered by development fees or under warranty), or developing and releasing newer versions of the certified API technology at the request of an API Information Source. The nature of the costs that can be charged under this category of permitted fees depends on the scope of the work undertaken by a Certified API Developer (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires of the Certified API Developer to upgrade the certified API technology being supplied from one version or set of functions to the next). Should API Users generate revenue from the use of their apps, any fee an API Information Source may impose would not be in scope for this Condition and Maintenance of Certification, but could be covered by the information blocking provisions.

That is, \u201cusage-based\u201d fees recover costs incurred by a Certified API Developer due to the actual use of the certified API technology once it has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified API technology). A Certified API Developer's \u201cincremental costs\u201d comprise the Certified API Developer's costs that are directly attributable to supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. A Certified API Developer should \u201cprice\u201d its costs of supporting access to the certified API technology by reference to the additional costs that the Certified API Developer would incur in supporting certain volumes of API use. Usage fees for certified API technology will only apply when the Certified API Developer acts on behalf of the API Information Source to deploy its certified API technology. In scenarios where the API Information Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified API technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the API Information Source\u2019s sole responsibility, and a Certified API Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees. The costs recovered under \u201cusage-based\u201d fees can only reflect \u201cpost-deployment\u201d costs. As such, \u201cusage-based\u201d fees cannot include any costs necessary to prepare and \u201cget the certified API technology up, running, and ready for use,\u201d which are costs that must be recovered as part of the deployment services delivered by the Certified API Developer if permitted under \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(3 )(ii). We clarify that API usage fees related to API \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients would be calculated using a similar methodology to calculate API usage fees related to API \u201cread\u201d services for single patients. These \u201cusage-based\u201d fees are fees imposed by a Certified API Developer to recover the costs typically incurred to support API interactions for API \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients once these services have been deployed. This could include, but not be limited to, costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified API technology (which could include higher costs for hardware, including server space).","title":"API Fees \u2013 Permitted Fee (Recovering API Usage Costs) - \u00a7\u2009170.404(A)(3)(III)"},{"location":"404-conditions-maintenance/#api-fees-permitted-fee-value-added-services-170404a3iv","text":"Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (A)(3)(IV) (iv) Permitted fee\u2014value-added services.

Applicability \u00b6 \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) is for all health IT developers who are certifying to the EHR base definition. The API certification criterion finalized in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) was included as part of the EHR Base Definition at \u00a7 170.102 . While developers of health information technology are not required by the ONC to meet certification requirements, including certification requirements that are included as part of the EHR Base Definition, several federal, state and tribal entities, including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and other programs reference the ONC Health IT Certification Program and require the use of certified health IT for program participation. Tools for testing and certification \u00b6 Inferno Program Edition / g10 Test Kit The Inferno Program Edition is used for ( g)(10 ) API testing for the ONC Health IT Certification Program . The Inferno Program Edition is a streamlined testing tool for services seeking to meet the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion finalized at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ). It is based on the requirements in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule and associated test procedure for \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) . This tool is used for testing and certification to the \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) certification criterion for the ONC Health IT Certification Program . Information and Clarifications \u00b6 Entire Criterion \u00b6 Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to the entire criterion On December 31, 2022, the API certification criterion in \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ) replaces the \u201capplication access\u2014data category request\u201d certification criterion (\u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(8 )). Health IT Modules are not required to support patient-facing API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients for the purposes of this certification criterion. The clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the \u201cClinical Notes Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ) must be represented in a \u201cplain text\u201d form, and it would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response. The intent of this policy is to prohibit Health IT Modules from converting clinical notes from a \u201cmachine readable\u201d format to a non-\u201cmachine readable\u201d format (e.g., PDF). Clinical note text that originates from outside Health IT Modules should be exchanged using its original format. Additionally, \u201cplain text\u201d does not necessarily mean the FHIR \u201ccontentType\u201d \u201ctext/plain.\u201d The US Core IG Profile \u201cStructureDefinition-us-core-patient\u201d element \u201cname.suffix\u201d is required for testing and certification in the ONC Certification Program to meet the USCDI requirement to support the \u201cPatient Demographics\u201d Data Class: \u201cSuffix\u201d Data Element. Either the US Core IG Profile \u201cStructureDefinition-us-core-patient\u201d element \u201cname.period\u201d or \u201cname.use\u201d is required for testing and certification in the ONC Certification Program to meet the USCDI requirement to support the \u201cPatient Demographics\u201d Data Class: \u201cPrevious Name\u201d Data Element. A Health IT Module must support at least one Choice or Reference for US Core IG \u201cmust support\u201d elements with multiple Choices or References, respectively. A Health IT Module must be conformant to the US Core IG for all Choices and References included in its standardized API , and cannot misrepresent Choices via the standardized API (e.g. a Health IT Module cannot transform \u201cinteger\u201d values to \u201cstring\u201d values). A health IT developer must document which US Core IG Choices and References are supported by their Health IT Module via public technical documentation to meet the requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and the transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Information originating from the ( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Module must conform to the requirements included in the criterion, but legacy information and information from outside systems is not required to be mapped to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) \u201cApplicable Standards\u201d and the US Core IG terminologies and value sets. However, health IT developers are encouraged to exceed the minimum requirements described in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) to support the mapping of legacy information to the terminologies and value sets included in the USCDI and US Core IG where possible. Additional clarifications that apply to the entire ( g)(10 ) criterion: The API certification criterion in \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ) replaces the \u201capplication access\u2014data category request\u201d certification criterion (\u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(8 )) and supports API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for single and multiple patients. The term \u201cservices\u201d includes all \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-related technical capabilities included in a Health IT Module presented for testing and certification. The API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for single patients is intended to support EHI requests and responses for individual patient records and the API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients is intended to support EHI requests and responses for multiple patients\u2019 records. The scope of patient cohorts for \u201cpopulation services\u201d can include various groups defined at the discretion of the user of the API -enabled \u201cread\u201d services for multiple patients, including, for example, a group of patients that meet certain disease criteria or fall under a certain insurance plan. The information blocking policies established by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule do not compel health care providers to implement Health IT Modules certified to requirements in \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 ). While there may be slight variation between each instance of a Standardized API for Patient and Population Services Health IT Module implemented by API Information Sources, we believe the standards that form the basis of the \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) certification criterion will enable interoperability across implementations. Data Response (Single Patient) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(A) (i) Data response. (A) Respond to requests for a single patient's data according to the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(1 ) and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ), including the mandatory capabilities described in \u201cUS Core Server CapabilityStatement,\u201d for each of the data included in the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 . All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported. Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(A) All data elements and operations indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported and are in-scope for testing. For \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d and \u201cPractitioner,\u201d US Core IG profiles, only the \u201cread\u201d type interaction must be supported and will be included in testing and certification. For the \u201cLocation\u201d FHIR resource, Health IT Modules must either demonstrate support for the \u201cread\u201d type interaction or demonstrate support for providing the \u201cLocation\u201d and FHIR resource references as a contained resource. The \u201csearch\u201d type interactions for these profiles and resource are not in scope for testing and certification. Health IT Modules must support these US Core IG profiles / FHIR resource because they are included as \u201cmust support\u201d data elements in US Core IG profiles required by the USCDI. Health IT Modules must support provenance according to the \u201cBasic Provenance Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG . Examples of \u201cmust support\u201d in the US Core IG 3.1.1: In US Core 3.1.1, the profile element Observation.value[x] contains the following Choices: Quantity, CodeableConcept, string, boolean, integer, Range, Ratio, SampledData, time, dateTime, Period A Health IT Module must support at least one of these Choices via the ( g)(10 ) standardized API . In US Core 3.1.1, the profile element Provenance.agent.who contains the following References: US Core Practitioner Profile, US Core Patient Profile, US Core Organization Profile A Health IT Module must support at least one of these References via the ( g)(10 ) standardized API . Data Response (Multiple Patients) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(B) (B) Respond to requests for multiple patients' data as a group according to the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(1 ), and implementation specifications adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ) and (4), for each of the data included in the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 . All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported. Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i)(B) Health IT Modules may support scopes using either \u201csystem/*.read\u201d or a list of \u201csystem/[resource].read,\u201d where [resource] is the FHIR resource name, to enable the export of multiple patients\u2019 data as a group. During testing and certification for multiple patient services, Health IT Modules must demonstrate support for \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d and \u201cPractitioner\u201d US Core IG FHIR Profiles. Health IT Modules must demonstrate support for \u201cLocation\u201d FHIR resources by providing this resource as part of the multiple patient services response, or by including it as a contained resource as part of the multiple patient services response. Health IT Modules must support provenance according to the \u201cBasic Provenance Guidance\u201d section of the US Core IG . Supported Search Operations (Single Patient) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(A) (ii) Supported search operations. (A) Respond to search requests for a single patient's data consistent with the search criteria included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ), specifically the mandatory capabilities described in \u201cUS Core Server CapabilityStatement.\u201d Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(A) All data elements indicated as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cmust support\u201d by the standards and implementation specifications must be supported and are in scope for testing. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : The scope of data available in the data responses defined in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i) must be supported for searches for multiple patients via the supported search operations finalized in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii). Supported Search Operations (Multiple Patients) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(B) (B) Respond to search requests for multiple patients' data consistent with the search criteria included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(a)(4) Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii)(B) No additional clarifications. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : The scope of data available in the data responses defined in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(i) must be supported for searches for multiple patients via the supported search operations finalized in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(ii). The HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR ) (v1.0.0: STU 1) implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215(a)(4) includes mandatory support for the \u201cgroup-export\u201d \"OperationDefinition.\" We have not included a requirement for Bulk FHIR import because the standards for these features are still being developed by industry. Applications or systems seeking to import information formatting according to the HL7 \u00ae FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR ) (V1.0.0:STU 1) can use several methods developed by industry, or can refer to Bulk FHIR import methods being defined by HL7 at the HL7 FHIR Bulk Data GitHub page . Application Registration \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iii) (iii) Application registration. Enable an application to register with the Health IT Module's \u201cauthorization server.\u201d Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iii) Health IT presented for testing and certification must support app registration regardless of the scope of patient search utilized by the application (e.g. single or multiple). This certification criterion requires a health IT developer, as finalized in the Condition of Certification requirements, to demonstrate its registration process, but does not require conformance to a standard. The third-party application registration process that a health IT developer must meet under this criterion is not a form of review or \u201cvetting\u201d for purposes of this criterion. For demonstration of the SMART IG \"Standalone Launch\" steps, health IT developers are permitted to scope US Core IG resources that do not exist in either the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.213 (USCDI version 1) or the \"Compartment Patient\" section of the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(1 ) ( HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1) as either patient/[Resource] or user/[Resource]. These resources include \u201cEncounter,\u201d \u201cDevice,\u201d \u201cLocation,\u201d \u201cMedication,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d \u201cPractitioner,\u201d and \u201cPractitionerRole.\u201d Health IT developers must document their supported scopes according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(viii)(A) and \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : We expect that apps executed within an implementer\u2019s clinical environment will be registered with an authorization server, but we do not require a health IT developer to demonstrate its registration process for these \u201cprovider-facing\u201d apps. The requirement that health IT developers must enable an application to register with the \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Module\u2019s authorization server only applies for the purposes of demonstrating technical conformance to the finalized certification criterion and API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements. The practices by all parties (including implementers of Health IT Modules) other than developers of certified Health IT Modules are not in scope for this certification criterion nor the associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements. Any practices associated with third-party application review or \u201cvetting\u201d by implementers must not violate the information blocking provisions established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule . Secure Connection (Patient / User Scopes) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(A) (iv) Secure connection. (A) Establish a secure and trusted connection with an application that requests data for patient and user scopes in accordance with the implementation specifications adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ) and (3). Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(A) Connections below TLS version 1.2 must be denied. Secure Connection (System Scopes) \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(B) (B) Establish a secure and trusted connection with an application that requests data for system scopes in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(a)(4). Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(iv)(B) Connections below TLS version 1.2 must be denied. First-time Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(1) (v) Authentication and authorization\u2014(A) Authentication and authorization for patient and user scopes\u2014(1) First time connections\u2014(i) Authentication and authorization must occur during the process of granting access to patient data in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) and standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215(b). (ii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret. (iii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token for a period of no less than three months to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1) Health IT Modules will be explicitly tested for US Core IG operations using authentication and authorization tokens acquired via the process described in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Only the relevant parts of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 including errata set 1 adopted in \u00a7 170.215(b) that are also included in the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) will be in-scope for testing and certification. The \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capabilities\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) are explicitly required for testing and certification because these capabilities are otherwise indicated as optional in the implementation specification. As part of the \u201cpermission-patient\u201d \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capability\u201d in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ), Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g., \u201cImmunization\u201d) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ). Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping resources under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user, using more granular scopes), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on resource-level scopes is available, if requested by the patient. Health IT Modules will only be tested for the \"Patient Access for Standalone Apps\" and \"Clinician Access for EHR Launch\" scenarios described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Since \"Encounter\" is not currently a USCDI Data Class or Data Element, we will not test Health IT Modules for support for \"context-ehr-encounter\" or \"context-standalone-encounter\" SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities described in the standard adopted at \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ).\u2009 Implementers of \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of the information blocking provisions. As part of the requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii), health IT developers must publish the method(s) by which their Health IT Modules support the secure issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications according to the technical documentation requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )(viii) and transparency conditions at \u00a7 170.404 ( a)(2 ). Application developer affirmations to health IT developers regarding the ability of their applications to secure a refresh token, a client secret, or both, must be treated in a good faith manner consistent with the provisions established in the openness and pro-competitive conditions at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (a)(4). Health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native applications and clarify that health IT developers are not required to support all methods third-party application developers seek to use. ONC recognizes there may be some ambiguity in the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 standard (incorporated by reference at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 )) in its guidance for supporting native applications, in particular, in providing references to best practices, strategies, and examples such as \u201cOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps: 8.5. Client Authentication\u201d, \u201cOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\u201d, and \u201cuniversal redirect_uris\u201d without a standardized solution. ONC provides flexibility for how the health IT developer implements the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework implementation specification, as long as the Certified Health IT Module supports for first time connections the issuance of three-month refresh tokens to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. The paragraph at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (SMART IG ) \u201cSMART [on FHIR ] Core Capabilities,\u201d including \u201cpermission-offline,\u201d which grants support for refresh tokens. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule states, \u201c\u2026Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization. If the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires\u2026\u201d ( 85 FR 25747 ). However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. ONC clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application\u2019s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant \u201coffline-access\u201d scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : We expect implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules to have the capability of revoking refresh tokens where appropriate. Neither \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) nor applicable API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements require restricting discretion of implementers (health care providers, clinician practices, hospitals, etc.) to set the length of refresh tokens for users of the API including patients and health care providers to align with their institutional policies. Implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules are not prohibited from implementing their \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules in accordance with their organizational security policies and posture, including by instituting policies for reauthentication and re-authorization (e.g., health care providers and/or patients could always be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize after a set number of refresh tokens have been issued). Patients are not prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens to the degree this option is available to them. Implementers of \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of information blocking provisions applicable to them and that requiring patients to reauthenticate and re-authorize at a high frequency could inhibit patient access and implicate information blocking. Refresh Tokens for Native Applications In RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) and the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART IG ) , some native applications are unable to claim they are confidential . By definition, these non-confidential native applications do not have a client_secret to exchange during the client authentication process. However, there are additional methods that non-confidential native applications can use to increase refresh token security during \u201cFirst time connections.\u201d Methods like Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the use of application-claimed, private-use Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes as redirect URIs, and utilizing on device secure storage techniques to securely store the refresh token can increase the security of an initial refresh token. Methods like these ensure that an authorization server issues initial access and refresh tokens to the correct corresponding authorized application. The paragraph in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii) requires that Health IT Modules provide support for the issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. Subsequent Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services \u00b6 Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(2) (2) Subsequent connections. (i) Access must be granted to patient data in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) without requiring reauthorization and re-authentication when a valid refresh token is supplied by the application. (ii) A Health IT Module's authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret. Clarifications included in the ( g)(10 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(2) No additional clarifications. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : For subsequent connections, certified Health IT Modules are not required to issue a new refresh token, but must issue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months. Whether the application receives a \u201cnew\u201d refresh token is an implementation decision left to the health IT developer, as long as the \u201crefreshed\u201d refresh token is valid for a new period of no less than three months. Refresh Tokens and Clients \"Capable of Storing a Client Secret\" As specified in RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) and the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART IG ) , authorization servers send and receive refresh tokens from their clients in two different parts of an OAuth 2.0 flow. First, after resource owner authorization, the authorization server sends an initial refresh token to the client with the initial access token. Second, when an access token has expired and needs to be refreshed, a client exchanges a refresh token for a new access token and optionally another refresh token, which occurs without user authorization. During both exchanges, security is increased (i.e. protecting against leaked refresh tokens) for confidential clients that have a client secret used for client authentication. The ( g)(10 ) criterion paragraphs at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(ii) and \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(2)(ii) require that clients \u201ccapable of storing a client secret\u201d must be given refresh tokens during both of these parts of the OAuth 2.0 flow.

The intent of this policy is to prohibit Health IT Modules from converting clinical notes from a \u201cmachine readable\u201d format to a non-\u201cmachine readable\u201d format (e.g., PDF). Clinical note text that originates from outside Health IT Modules should be exchanged using its original format.

A Health IT Module must support at least one Choice or Reference for US Core IG \u201cmust support\u201d elements with multiple Choices or References, respectively. A Health IT Module must be conformant to the US Core IG for all Choices and References included in its standardized API , and cannot misrepresent Choices via the standardized API (e.g. a Health IT Module cannot transform \u201cinteger\u201d values to \u201cstring\u201d values).

The \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capabilities\u201d in \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) are explicitly required for testing and certification because these capabilities are otherwise indicated as optional in the implementation specification. As part of the \u201cpermission-patient\u201d \u201cSMART on FHIR Core Capability\u201d in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ), Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g., \u201cImmunization\u201d) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in \u00a7\u2009 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(2 ). Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping resources under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user, using more granular scopes), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on resource-level scopes is available, if requested by the patient. Health IT Modules will only be tested for the \"Patient Access for Standalone Apps\" and \"Clinician Access for EHR Launch\" scenarios described in the standard adopted at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ). Since \"Encounter\" is not currently a USCDI Data Class or Data Element, we will not test Health IT Modules for support for \"context-ehr-encounter\" or \"context-standalone-encounter\" SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities described in the standard adopted at \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ).\u2009 Implementers of \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of the information blocking provisions.

Application developer affirmations to health IT developers regarding the ability of their applications to secure a refresh token, a client secret, or both, must be treated in a good faith manner consistent with the provisions established in the openness and pro-competitive conditions at \u00a7\u2009 170.404 (a)(4). Health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native applications and clarify that health IT developers are not required to support all methods third-party application developers seek to use. ONC recognizes there may be some ambiguity in the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 standard (incorporated by reference at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 )) in its guidance for supporting native applications, in particular, in providing references to best practices, strategies, and examples such as \u201cOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps: 8.5. Client Authentication\u201d, \u201cOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\u201d, and \u201cuniversal redirect_uris\u201d without a standardized solution. ONC provides flexibility for how the health IT developer implements the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework implementation specification, as long as the Certified Health IT Module supports for first time connections the issuance of three-month refresh tokens to native applications capable of securing a refresh token. The paragraph at \u00a7 170.215( a)(3 ) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (SMART IG ) \u201cSMART [on FHIR ] Core Capabilities,\u201d including \u201cpermission-offline,\u201d which grants support for refresh tokens. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule states, \u201c\u2026Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in \u00a7\u2009170.215( a)(3 ) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization. If the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires\u2026\u201d ( 85 FR 25747 ). However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the \u201coffline_access\u201d scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. ONC clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application\u2019s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant \u201coffline-access\u201d scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access. Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : We expect implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules to have the capability of revoking refresh tokens where appropriate. Neither \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) nor applicable API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements require restricting discretion of implementers (health care providers, clinician practices, hospitals, etc.) to set the length of refresh tokens for users of the API including patients and health care providers to align with their institutional policies. Implementers of \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules are not prohibited from implementing their \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules in accordance with their organizational security policies and posture, including by instituting policies for reauthentication and re-authorization (e.g., health care providers and/or patients could always be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize after a set number of refresh tokens have been issued). Patients are not prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens to the degree this option is available to them. Implementers of \u00a7\u2009170.315( g)(10 )-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of information blocking provisions applicable to them and that requiring patients to reauthenticate and re-authorize at a high frequency could inhibit patient access and implicate information blocking. Refresh Tokens for Native Applications In RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) and the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART IG ) , some native applications are unable to claim they are confidential . By definition, these non-confidential native applications do not have a client_secret to exchange during the client authentication process. However, there are additional methods that non-confidential native applications can use to increase refresh token security during \u201cFirst time connections.\u201d Methods like Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the use of application-claimed, private-use Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes as redirect URIs, and utilizing on device secure storage techniques to securely store the refresh token can increase the security of an initial refresh token. Methods like these ensure that an authorization server issues initial access and refresh tokens to the correct corresponding authorized application. The paragraph in \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(iii) requires that Health IT Modules provide support for the issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications capable of securing a refresh token.","title":"First-time Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services"},{"location":"g10-criterion/#subsequent-authentication-authorization-for-single-patient-services","text":"Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(V)(A)(2) (2) Subsequent connections.

Additional Clarifications to the ( g)(10 ) CCG : For subsequent connections, certified Health IT Modules are not required to issue a new refresh token, but must issue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months. Whether the application receives a \u201cnew\u201d refresh token is an implementation decision left to the health IT developer, as long as the \u201crefreshed\u201d refresh token is valid for a new period of no less than three months. Refresh Tokens and Clients \"Capable of Storing a Client Secret\" As specified in RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) and the HL7 \u00ae SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART IG ) , authorization servers send and receive refresh tokens from their clients in two different parts of an OAuth 2.0 flow. First, after resource owner authorization, the authorization server sends an initial refresh token to the client with the initial access token. Second, when an access token has expired and needs to be refreshed, a client exchanges a refresh token for a new access token and optionally another refresh token, which occurs without user authorization. During both exchanges, security is increased (i.e. protecting against leaked refresh tokens) for confidential clients that have a client secret used for client authentication. The ( g)(10 ) criterion paragraphs at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(1)(ii) and \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(A)(2)(ii) require that clients \u201ccapable of storing a client secret\u201d must be given refresh tokens during both of these parts of the OAuth 2.0 flow. Requiring that such clients be given a refresh token valid for a new period of three months during this second part of the OAuth 2.0 flow enables indefinite persistent access without the need for user re-authorization.","title":"Subsequent Authentication / Authorization for Single Patient Services"},{"location":"g10-criterion/#authentication-authorization-for-multiple-patient-services","text":"Regulation text at \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 )(v)(B) (B) Authentication and authorization for system scopes.

There is no standard required for the format of the data category request, as long as the data returned are in a computable format (machine-readable format). [see also 80 FR 62678 ] The technology specifications should be designed and implemented in such a way as to return meaningful responses to queries, particularly with regard to exceptions and exception handling, and should make it easy for applications to discover what data exists for the patient. [see also 80 FR 62678 ] The term \u201ctoken\u201d that is used here is not to be interpreted as the token in the OAuth2 workflow, but simply as something that would uniquely identify a patient. The developer can determine the method and the amount of data by which the health IT uniquely identifies a patient. [see also 80 FR 62678 ] The Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) definition lists a set of data. It does not, however, specify a set of \u201cdata categories\u201d or prescribe a predefined grouping for API responses as may be implied by the regulatory text. Consistent with the intent expressed for this functionality in the proposed rule [ 80 FR 16861 ], which conveyed that we intended to \u201callow for but not require, health IT developers to implement the Fast Health Interoperability Resource ( FHIR \u00ae)\u201d and which we carried forward with the final rule, a health IT developer is permitted and has the flexibility to group the data specified in the CCDS in its API responses in a manner that it sees fit. This could be in manner following a particular industry standard, such as FHIR , or other documented means. In doing so a health IT developer must ensure: That the \u201c API response groupings\u201d it uses ultimately cover all of the data specified in the CCDS. For example, if a health IT developer had 10 API response groupings, all of data specified by the CCDS definition would need to be covered by those 10 API responses. The technical documentation it discloses clearly specifies how all of the data specified CCDS is met by its API response groupings. Functional Requirements (Date & Date Range) \u00b6 Clarifications included in the ( g)(8 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 )(i)(B) Health IT returning an entire patient record that does not reflect the specific date or date range requested is not permissible when a specific date or date range is requested. [see also 80 FR 62678 ] The API must be able to send, at a minimum all required data for a specified date range(s). We acknowledge that there will be organizational policies and/or safety best practices that will dictate additional data to be sent and when data is considered complete and/or ready for being sent. This should be appropriately described in the API documentation. However, returning no data on receipt of a valid date or date range, or sending an error message (which is equivalent to no data) is not permissible. Documentation Requirements ( API Interface) \u00b6 Clarifications included in the ( g)(8 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 )(ii)(A)(1) API documentation must include information for requesting patient data using date and date ranges.

Documentation Requirements ( API Terms of Use) \u00b6 Clarifications included in the ( g)(8 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 )(ii)(A)(3) Health IT developers must be clear and transparent about the general terms of agreements or contracts that will typically apply to all prospective third party applications. Health IT developers that typically execute unique agreements or contracts with interested third party applications using their API must disclose this practice as part of their terms of use. For the purposes of certification, a health IT developer is accountable for documenting and making public the provisions of its API \u2019s terms of use. If, post-certification, a health IT developer permits its customers to deploy and integrate its API in ways where the customer would be able to layer on its own specific terms of use unique to that organization, the health IT developer would need to disclose this business practice in its terms of use. A health IT developer is not expected to change or factor instances into its terms of use where its customers establish additional, organizational-specific terms for the API \u2019s use. Pursuant to the certification criterion\u2019s documentation requirement, health IT developers are required to make their API documentation publicly available, including the terms of use (and its associated policies and required developer agreements). Developers\u2019 enforcement of their terms of use is beyond the scope of conformance to this certification criterion. This criterion focuses on the technical API capabilities with which a Health IT Module must be in compliance and documentation requirements as specified. For example, this certification criterion does not require health IT developers to evaluate app developers or prohibit such activity (though such activities may implicate other requirements of the Program). We also note that CMS, specifically in the patient access context, states that \u201c[p]roviders may not prohibit patients from using any application, including third-party applications, which meet the technical specifications of the API , including the security requirements of the API .\u201d3 Documentation Requirements (Availability) \u00b6 Clarifications included in the ( g)(8 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 )(ii)(B) The hyperlink provided for all of the documentation referenced by provision ( g)(8 )(ii)(A) must reflect the most current version of the Health IT developer\u2019s documentation. All of the documentation referenced by provision ( g)(8 )(ii)(A) must be accessible to the public via a hyperlink without additional access requirements, including, without limitation, any form of registration, account creation, \u201cclick-through\u201d agreements, or requirement to provide contact details or other information prior to accessing the documentation.","title":"Non-standarized data request API criterion - (g)(8)"},{"location":"g8-criterion/#non-standarized-data-request-api-criterion-170315g8","text":"","title":"Non-standarized Data Request API Criterion \u00a7 170.315(g)(8)"},{"location":"g8-criterion/#information-and-clarifications","text":"","title":"Information and Clarifications"},{"location":"g8-criterion/#entire-criterion","text":"Clarifications included in the ( g)(8 ) CCG that apply to the entire criterion While no content exchange standard is required for this criterion, we intend to adopt a standards-based approach for certification in a future rulemaking. We encourage the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ( FHIR ) specification. Security: For the purposes of certification there is no conformance requirement related to the registration of third party applications that use the APIs . If a Health IT module requires registration as a pre-condition for accessing the APIs , then, the process must be clearly specified in the API documentation as required by the criterion. We strongly believe that registration should not be used as a means to block information sharing via APIs . This criterion does not currently include any security requirements beyond the privacy and security approach detailed above, but we encourage organizations to follow security best practices and implement security controls, such as penetration testing, encryption, audits, and monitoring as appropriate. We expect health IT developers to include information on how to securely use their APIs in the public documentation required by the certification criteria and follow industry best practices. [see also 80 FR 62676 ] We strongly encourage developers to build security into their APIs following best practice guidance, such as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Build Security In initiative.1 [see also 80 FR 62677 ] A \u201ctrusted connection\u201d means the link is encrypted/integrity protected according to \u00a7 170.210( a)(2 ) or (c)(2). As such, we do not believe it is necessary to specifically name HTTPS and/or SSL/TLS as this standard already covers encryption and integrity protection for data in motion. [see also 80 FR 62676 ] APIs could be used when consent or authorization by an individual is required. In circumstances where there is a requirement to document a patient\u2019s request or particular preferences, APIs can enable compliance with documentation requirements. The HIPAA Privacy Rule2 permits the use of electronic documents to qualify as writings for the purpose of proving signature, e.g., electronic signatures. [see also 80 FR 62677 ] The audit record should be able to distinguish the specific user who accessed the data using a third-party application through the certified API in order to meet the requirements of \u00a7 170.315(d)(2) or (d)(10). A health IT developer must demonstrate that its API functionality properly performs consistent with this certification criterion\u2019s requirements. How this is done is up to the health IT developer. Doing so could include, but is not limited to, the health IT developer using existing tools or creating its own app or \u201cclient\u201d to interact with the API as well as using a third-party application. By requiring that documentation and terms of use be open and transparent to the public by requiring a hyperlink to such documentation to be published with the product on the ONC Certified Health IT Product List, we hope to encourage an open ecosystem of diverse and innovative applications that can successfully and easily interact with different Health IT Modules\u2019 APIs . [see also 80 FR 62679 ] Health IT developers are able to update/upgrade/improve functionality that\u2019s within the scope of certification, provided that certain rules and conditions are followed. The \u201c API criteria\u201d \u00a7 170.315( g)(7 ), \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 ), and \u00a7 170.315( g)(9 ) are treated no different under this regulatory structure. If a developer seeks to update their API functionality post-certification a developer will need to consider the following: If their ONC -ACB requires notification or updated documentation associated with the functionality they changed. This procedure is at the discretion of the ONC -ACB and may result in an additional CHPL listing. Pursuant to the certification criteria, there is a documentation portion in each. Which would include (publicly available) technical specs, configuration requirements, and terms of use. Insofar as a developer updates their API post-certification, they are expected to keep all of this documentation up-to-date. Similarly, ONC -ACBs are expected to oversee/enforce/surveil that this action is taken and could find a non-conformity if those updates are not made. If any of their changes would require updates to the developer\u2019s \u00a7 170.523(k)(1) disclosures (the broader product transparency disclosures). \u00a7 170.315( g)(10 ) will replace \u00a7 170.315( g)(8 ).

There will be a 90-day delay from the time the CCG has been updated with the ONC -approved corrections to when compliance with the corrections will be required to pass testing (i.e., C-CDA 2.1 Validator).There will be an 18-month delay before a finding of a correction\u2019s absence in certified health IT during surveillance would constitute a non-conformity under the Program.","title":"Functional Requirements (Data Categories)"},{"location":"g9-criterion/#functional-requirements-date-date-range","text":"Clarifications included in the ( g)(9 ) CCG that apply to paragraph \u00a7 170.315( g)(9 )(i)(B) Health IT returning an entire patient record that does not reflect the specific date or date range requested is not permissible when a specific date or date range is requested.
